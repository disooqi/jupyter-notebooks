    "- The learning rate, $\\alpha$, is most important hyperparameter for the most applications.\n",
    "- The momentum term $\\beta$, the number of hidden units, and the mini-batch size are considered the second important hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to select the hyperparameters?\n",
    "- In deep learning, as the number of the hyperparameters tends to be large comparing to traditional machine learning algms choose the hyperparameter in random; don't use grid to choose them.\n",
    "- Another reason to choose the hyperparameter in random is that you don't know which hyperparameters are important than others for your application.\n",
    "- A good practice when you sampling a hyperparameter is to follow Coarse to fine sampling scheme (or search process)\n"
